## 📖 Structure of a Linux System

A Linux system is generally divided into three main parts:

### 🖥️ 1. **Hardware**
This includes all the physical components that your system runs on:
- CPU
- RAM
- Disks
- Peripherals

### 🧠 2. **Linux Kernel**
The **core** of the Linux operating system.  
It manages communication between hardware and software:
- Controls memory and processes
- Manages device drivers and system calls
- Handles networking and filesystems

### 👤 3. **User Space**
Where users and applications interact with the system.  
This includes:
- User interfaces (shells, GUIs)
- Utilities and commands (e.g., `ls`, `grep`, `nano`)
- User processes and services
